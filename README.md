Deploying a Node JS Application on AWS EC2.

Part: 01
First we will test and deploy the application on local server before delivering or deploying to external world. 
Testing a project locally before deploying it to an external environment like AWS EC2 is an essential step to ensure the application is running properly and free from any issues. There are several reasons why local testing is crucial:

Early Detection of Issues
Identify Bugs Early: By testing locally, you can catch potential bugs, errors, and performance issues before deploying the project to an external server. This saves time and effort by ensuring issues are addressed before they impact users in the production environment.

Debugging: Local environments are easier to debug than remote servers. You can use various debugging tools to trace errors, test breakpoints, and inspect logs locally without affecting real users.
